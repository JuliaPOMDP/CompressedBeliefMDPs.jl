abstract = {POMDPs.jl is an open-source framework for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs). POMDPs.jl allows users to specify sequential decision making problems with minimal effort without sacrificing the expressive nature of POMDPs, making this framework viable for both educational and research purposes. It is written in the Julia language to allow flexible prototyping and large-scale computation that leverages the high-performance nature of the language. The associated JuliaPOMDP community also provides a number of state-of-the-art MDP and POMDP solvers and a rich library of support tools to help with implementing new solvers and evaluating the solution results.

We begin by introducing the theory of Markov decision processes (mdps) and partially observable MDPs (pomdps). We then outline a novel algorithm for solving pomdps off line and show how, in some cases, a finite-memory controller can be extracted from the solution to a POMDP. We conclude with a discussion of how our approach relates to previous work, the complexity of finding exact solutions to pomdps, and of some possibilities for finding approximate solutions.}

abstract = { Mission-critical exploration of uncertain environments requires reliable and robust mechanisms for achieving information gain. Typical measures of information gain such as Shannon entropy and KL divergence are unable to distinguish between different bimodal probability distributions or introduce bias toward one mode of a bimodal probability distribution. The use of a standard deviation (SD) metric reduces bias while retaining the ability to distinguish between higher and lower risk distributions. Areas of high SD can be safely explored through observation with an autonomous Mars Helicopter allowing safer and faster path plans for ground-based rovers. First, this study presents a single-agent information-theoretic utility-based path planning method for a highly correlated uncertain environment. Then, an information-theoretic two-stage multiagent rapidly exploring random tree framework is presented, which guides Mars helicopter through regions of high SD to reduce uncertainty for the rover. In a Monte Carlo simulation, we compare our information-theoretic framework with a rover-only approach and a naive approach, in which the helicopter scouts ahead of the rover along its planned path. Finally, the model is demonstrated in a case study on the Jezero region of Mars. Results show that the information-theoretic helicopter improves the travel time for the rover on average when compared with the rover alone or with the helicopter scouting ahead along the rover’s initially planned route. }}

abstract = {This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

All three variants of the problem finite horizon, infinite horizon discounted, and infinite horizon average cost were known to be solvable in polynomial time by dynamic programming finite horizon problems, linear programming, or successive approximation techniques infinite horizon. We show that they are complete for P, and therefore most likely cannot be solved by highly parallel algorithms. We also show that, in contrast, the deterministic cases of all three problems can be solved very fast in parallel. The version with partially observed states is shown to be PSPACE-complete, and thus even less likely to be solved in polynomial time than the NP-complete problems; in fact, we show that, most likely, it is not possible to have an efficient on-line implementation involving polynomial time on-line computations and memory of an optimal policy, even if an arbitrary amount of precomputation is allowed. Finally, the variant of the problem in which there are no observations is shown to be NP-complete.},

abstract = {Automated planning, the problem of how an agent achieves a goal given a repertoire of actions, is one of the foundational and most widely studied problems in the AI literature. The original formulation of the problem makes strong assumptions regarding the agent's knowledge and control over the world, namely that its information is complete and correct, and that the results of its actions are deterministic and known. Recent research in planning under uncertainty has endeavored to relax these assumptions, providing formal and computation models wherein the agent has incomplete or noisy information about the world and has noisy sensors and effectors. This research has mainly taken one of two approaches: extend the classical planning paradigm to a semantics that admits uncertainty, or adopt another framework for approaching the problem, most commonly the Markov Decision Process (MDP) model. This paper presents a complexity analysis of planning under uncertainty. It begins with the “probabilistic classical planning” problem, showing that problem to be formally undecidable. This fundamental result is then applied to a broad class of stochastic optimization problems, in brief any problem statement where the agent (a) operates over an infinite or indefinite time horizon, and (b) has available only probabilistic information about the system's state. Undecidability is established for policy-existence problems for partially observable infinite-horizon Markov decision processes under discounted and undiscounted total reward models, average-reward models, and state-avoidance models. The results also apply to corresponding approximation problems with undiscounted objective functions. The paper answers a significant open question raised by Papadimitriou and Tsitsiklis [Math. Oper. Res. 12 (3) (1987) 441–450] about the complexity of infinite horizon POMDPs.}

Experiments in this area have produced mixed results; there have been both notable successes and notable disappointments. Theory has been scarce, mostly due to the difficulty of reasoning about function approximators that generalize beyond the observed data. We provide a proof of convergence for a wide class of temporal difference methods involving function approximators such as k-nearest-neighbor, and show experimentally that these methods can be useful. The proof is based on a view of function approximators as expansion or contraction mappings. In addition, we present a novel view of fitted value iteration: an approximate algorithm for one environment turns out to be an exact algorithm for a different environment.}
